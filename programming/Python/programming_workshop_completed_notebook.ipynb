    "So far, we've used variables to store individual values. When programming, you'll often want to store many more values than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "List, tuples, and dictionaries are all example of **data structures** - places to store multiple pieces of information together. These three data structures are all quite similar, but they do have key differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about these structures, it's important to bear three key terms in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ordered** - the items in a structure are always in the same order\n",
    "2. **indexed** - any item in a structure is accessible directly if you know the **index value**.\n",
    "3. **mutable** - the items in a structure can be changed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can store values of any type. The values in a list are referred to as **elements** or **items**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Lists are created using square brackets, and the elements are separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As lists are numerically indexed, you can access any time just by knowing its position in the list. In Python (and in many other programming languages), numerical indexes start at 0, so the first item in a list is found at index 0, the second at at index 1, and so on."
